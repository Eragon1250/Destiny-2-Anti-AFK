# Destiny-2-Anti-AFK
prevents you from beeing flagged as "AFK" in Destiny 2 by walking around randomly and revives you when every possible

Needs Python to work
Needs the followig Python libarys to work:
1. keyboard
2. pynput
3. time
4. random

iam using Visual Studiyo code to run this, but maybe it also works with other Programms.

How to controll:
Press `*` short to start the programm, after starting you can stop it by also pressing `*`,
but for a variable timespan, press it until it stops, to start again simply press `*` for a short time again.

Before using this programm make shure that its allowed in te AGBs and the law in your country and the Servers rules and stuff like that
